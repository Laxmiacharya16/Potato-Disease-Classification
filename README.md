Plant Disease Classification with TensorFlow

This project aims to classify plant diseases using TensorFlow. The dataset used for this project is the Plant Village dataset from Kaggle.
Overview

In this project, we build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images of plant leaves into three classes: Potato___Early_blight, Potato___Late_blight, and Potato___healthy.
Dataset

The dataset consists of images of plant leaves from various sources, annotated with labels indicating the type of disease or health status. You can download the dataset from here.
Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-classification.git

Install the required dependencies

Usage

    Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
    Run the Jupyter notebook plant_disease_classification.ipynb to train the model and evaluate its performance.
    Use the trained model for inference by loading it and making predictions on new images.

Model

The model architecture consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. We trained the model using the Adam optimizer and evaluated it using Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss.
Results

After training the model for 25 epochs, we achieved an accuracy of XX% on the validation set.
